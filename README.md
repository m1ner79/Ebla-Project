## What is Ebla?

Ebla is one of the most extensive archaeological sites from the Bronze Age in western Syria. Excavations in Elba unearthed one of the biggest and the oldest archives ever found from the third millennium BC.

## Ebla of today.

Our project is focused to inject automation into archivisation. No more worries that some of your historical conversations will vanish. With Ebla Project your archive will update automatically.
Initially we will focus on Slack but after that, who knows, GitHub, Twitter... World is our oyster.
